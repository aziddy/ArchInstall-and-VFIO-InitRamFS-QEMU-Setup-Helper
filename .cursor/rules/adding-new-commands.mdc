## When adding new steps to an exisiting scripts or making new scripts, make to have the following features:
- If changes need to be appiled to a specifc libvert/QEMU VM, show list of available VMs and ask user to type in VM name they want to choose
    - Use @additional_scripts/disable-memballoon.sh as a reference for selecting VM code 
- Check if the changes are already applied, warn user, exit script without applying changes again
- Make sure that if the same script is ran multiple times that it doesnt keep appending the same change to the relevant files more than once
